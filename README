This directory was created to contain all the superfluous LaTeX additions that I use personally in my documents including custom bibliography scripts, shorthands, and styles. The reason I place them all in this folder is so I can migrate them to difference machines. To use these additions, the latex engine must know about them. Place a symbolic link to this folder where Latex will search for such files, ie "ln -s ~/.latex-mods ~/.texmf/tex/latex".
